# This is a configuration file for "cloudgen", for the generation of
# stochastic cloud fields - just run "cloudgen cirrus.dat". The output
# is written to a NetCDF file named "out.nc" by default.

# The file format is simple: a set of parameter-value pairs, where
# value can be a boolean, a number, an array of numbers or a
# string. Any of the parameters can be overridden on the command line
# with cloudgen parameter="value" cirrus.dat.  "Parameter" is case
# insensitive.

# The "verbose" parameter is a boolean which determines whether
# progress information is reported by the program.  It is treated as
# "false" if it is either not present, or it is present and set to 0
# or "false". If it is set and is any other value (including just the
# name of the variable being present) then it is regarded as "true".
verbose


## DOMAIN SETTINGS

# Set the domain size in metres - note that the y domain is
# automatically the same size as the x domain.
x_domain_size 200000
z_domain_size 3500

# Number of pixels in each direction - note that the y domain
# automatically has the same number of pixels as the x domain.
x_pixels 256
z_pixels 32

# The output file contains x, y and z variables, which can be offset
# from the origin using the following:
#x_offset 0
#y_offset 0
z_offset 7000


## RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR

# To generate different cloud fields we use random phases in calls to
# the first inverse Fourier transform.  By using a "seed" the same
# sequence of random numbers will be produced and the same cloud field
# generated - remember that this value can be overwritten on the
# command line
seed 2

# Later Linux kernels provide a device file from which random bits can
# be read that can be used to seed the random number generator and
# produce different cloud fields every time:
#system_random_file /dev/random


## 3D SPECTRAL PROPERTIES 

# Exponent of the power spectrum in the vertical direction.
vertical_exponent -2

# The power spectrum becomes flat at scales larger than "outer_scale"
# metres.
outer_scale 50000


## HEIGHT DEPENDENT PROPERTIES

# All the height-dependent parameters are entered on the same grid,
# the at the heights in the "interp_height" vector. They are
# interpolated on to the domain grid. If interp_height is not present
# then none of the height dependent properties will be implemented
interp_height 7000 7500 8000 8500 9000 9500 10000 10500

# For horizontal displacement, this can either be specified
# explicitly:
#x_displacement 20000 10000 5000 0 0
#y_displacement 0 0 0 0 0

# ...or it can be calculated from an x-y wind profile (in metres per
# second), a cloud particle fall speed profile (in metres per second)
# and a "generating level" in metres which is usually near cloud top.
v_wind 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 40
u_wind 5 2.5 0 -1 0 2.5 5 5
fall_speed 1 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3
generating_level 9500

# You can scale the wind as follows - this is useful to test the
# dependence on wind shear
#wind_scale_factor 1

# The height variation of the exponent of the horizontal power
# spectrum can be specified here
horizontal_exponent -1.667 -3 -2.5 -2 -1.667 -1.667 -1.667 -1.667

# The mixing represented by a change in the horizontal exponent may be
# anisotropic - i.e. smoother in direction of orientation of the
# fallstreak with respect to the generating level: just set the
# boolean "anisotropic_mixing".
anisotropic_mixing


## SCALING THE FIELD

# The distribution is either Gaussian or lognormal, determined by the
# boolean "lognormal_distribution".
lognormal_distribution

# The distribution is scaled using the vectors "mean" and
# "standard_deviation". In the case of a lognormal distribution,
# standard_deviation is actually the fractional standard deviation,
# i.e. the standard deviation of the natural logarithm of the field.
mean 0.0 0.06 0.05 0.04 0.02 0.01 0.0001 0
standard_deviation 2 1 1.25 1.5 1.75 2 2.1 2.2 


# A minimum value can be defined using "threshold" - if set, values
# beneath this will be set to missing_value.
threshold 0.001
missing_value -999.0
