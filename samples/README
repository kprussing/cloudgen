This directory contains sample configuration files for "cloudgen". To
run the program on file.dat, simply type "cloudgen file.dat". The
files in this directory are:

cirrus.dat
  An idealised case, with all the parameters described in the
  comments. A stochastic field of ice water content is generated.
  Note that this file is not based on real observations.

cirrus_with_effective_radius.dat
  The same idealised case but demonstrating how effective radius may
  be generated with a specified correlation to ice water content.

1999*.dat
  Four cases derived from the 94-GHz cloud radar at Chilbolton in
  southern England, with progressively increasing domain-mean water
  content. They do not produce effective radius fields. Three of
  these cases were used by Hogan and Kew (2005) to estimate the
  radiative effects of cirrus inhomogeneity. The fourth (19990717.dat)
  was used in a conference paper by Hogan and Kew (2004).

1999*_nomixing.dat
  The same cases but with the standard deviations and spectral
  exponents adjusted to remove the homogenising effects of wind
  shear.

stratocumulus.dat
  An idealised stratocumulus case, with all the parameters described
  in the comments. A stochastic field of liquid water content is
  generated. Note that this file is not based on real observations.

generate_cases_varying_windshear.sh
  A shell script for generating sets of cirrus simulations with
  different wind shears; this shows how configuration parameters may
  be overridden on the command line.

generate_nomixing_varying_windshear.sh
  The same but using the 199*_nomixing.dat input data files.
